  The simplest way to display the data is with a one-dimensional line chart covering the entire time span, allowing for a quick overview of data range and maximum values.
  
  However, this approach can be too dense for detailed observations, making it challenging to relate specific behaviors to timestamps.
  
  To address this, we calculated daily energy consumption, reducing data points by a factor of 96 (24 hours divided by 15 minutes). This adjustment provides a clearer view of trends across different seasons.
  
  Another strategy to simplify visualization involves focusing on just one week of data, revealing recurring patterns that unfold each day.
  
  For a more insightful analysis of regularities, we calculated the mean consumption profile by averaging consumption at each time of day over the entire measurement period.
  
  This approach highlights a notable nighttime peak in consumption, offering a clear understanding of daily energy usage patterns.
